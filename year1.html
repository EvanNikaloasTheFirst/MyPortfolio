    <p>Hello there!</p>
    <p>
            My name is Evangelos and I am a Software engineering student at the University Of Northampton. I have always enjoyed
            working with technology and the concept of creating things from scratch or from a model. I am working towards a degree
            in tech because of my passion for contributing to products which will serve use to others.
             Working in a team is something I really enjoy as I enjoy exchanging ideas with others as we can always see ideas
              from different perspectives broadaning our knowledge. I also enjoy working independently as I thrive of from the
              responsibility of have requirement that need to be met. his is something that has always motivated me as I am seeing a project I have contributed to being used to help
              people's lives for the better.
              I was first introduced to programming in 2020 where I took an introduction into Java learning the basics such as
              variables , loops and datatypes. I have since worked with and will be working with:</p>

                <li> - C</li>
                <li> - HTML</li>
                <li> - CSS</li>
                <li> - Java</li>
                <li> - PHP</li>
                <li> - UML</li>
                <li> - C++</li>
                <li> - JavaScript</li>
            </ul>

                Software Engineering 1 – In this module we were tasked with producing the foundations for producing a DBMS & website  for a client. 
                  We used industry style methods to obtain information which  allowed me and my teammates to produce products which were in line with
                  the customers’ requirements. Such methodologies such as project development methodology, interview findings and system reviews where all 
                  performed in addition to legal legislations, life cycles and performance requirements were identified. These where just a few techniques 
                  used and taught to us to implement in a professional environment. 
                  Here is a screenshot of the what will be the final design for the client which will be our solution to their database queries.

            <p> In this class we were introduced into basic concepts of programming , Java in particular. We were set weekly lab tasks to develop our understanding of the concepts and were set two exams , one at the end of each term to test our understanding of what has been introduced to us.
                We was taught the following: Object oriented programming,Classes , Objects , Inheritence, Loops , Data structures, Methods and  Advanced array concepts (Bubble sort ...)

            <img src="marleyspage.png" alt="Marley's Website" id="marley">
            <p>In this class I was introduced with the basic abilities of HTML5 and CSS. I learned how to create simple and static webpage, changing the styles of the that staic webpage and anding different fonts within. I also learned how to use grid to layout elements in the website in a uniformed format. Allowing the page to look organized and formatted. Animations were introduced & this allowed me to make the page look more resposnive and dynamic. Elements which all website have. Mobile optimization was an aspect covered as most websites if not all are accessed through portable devices not just computers. Later on I was taught how to use version control and the importance of it - the version control program I use is the industry standard application called GitHub. Further on I was introduced on how to inmplement HTML forms - for the use of contact forms, Advanced CSS selectors - this was used to access specific elements within my webpage in a more fluid way rather than having to constantly produce section tags.With the skills I have learned here I have not only produced a portfolio for myself , i have also created a portfolio for a friend of mine who is a musician.</p>
